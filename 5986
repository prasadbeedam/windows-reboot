Yes, WinRM on ports 5985 and 5986 can be vulnerable—depending on how you configure and secure it. Here's a breakdown:

🔓 Port 5985 (HTTP) – Unencrypted
Plaintext traffic: Passwords and commands are sent unencrypted unless additional security is enforced (e.g., HTTPS or message-level encryption via Kerberos/NTLM).

Vulnerable to:

Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

Credential theft

Replay attacks

❌ Never use port 5985 in production across public or untrusted networks.

🔐 Port 5986 (HTTPS) – Encrypted
Uses SSL/TLS encryption.

Requires a valid certificate on the remote machine.

Much safer than 5985 if configured properly.

Still vulnerable if:

Using self-signed certs without proper validation.

Weak TLS versions are enabled (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1).

Certificates are expired or not trusted.

✅ Recommended for secure remote management.

✅ Best Practices to Secure WinRM
Practice	Recommendation
🔒 Protocol	Use HTTPS (5986) only
🔐 Authentication	Prefer Kerberos or certificate-based auth. Avoid Basic
🔁 Encryption	Disable 5985 or enforce message-level encryption if must use
🔍 Firewall	Allow access to 5986 only from specific IPs or management machines
🧾 Audit	Enable PowerShell transcription logging, WinRM logs
📜 Cert Management	Use a valid CA-signed cert, auto-renew with tools like Certbot (if domain joined)

🧠 Summary
Port	Secure?	Protocol	Recommendation
5985	❌ No	HTTP	Disable or restrict to internal trusted LAN only
5986	✅ Yes	HTTPS	Use with proper TLS + certificate config
